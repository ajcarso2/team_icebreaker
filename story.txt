Icebreaker story
There once was a man who absolutely, hated his Klimaanlage.
Every day it would spew the smell of Hund all over his apartment.
So one day he decided to get rid of it and went to the store to buy some Gift.
While he was at the store he got hungry and also bought a Apfelkuchen.
He decided to get some Bratwurst
but it was so rancid that he went to the Ratskeller to complain.
while on his way back to Berlin, he remembered that he had to get his girlfriend a birthday gift, so he had to stop at the mall and got her a pretty Dirndel
At the mall he also came across a mehlhase digging at the tile.
